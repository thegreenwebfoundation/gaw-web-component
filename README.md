# Grid-aware Websites Info Bar

This web component is designed to work with the [Grid-aware Websites library](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-aware-websites). It aims to provide website users with contextual information about their local energy grid and enables customization options for grid-aware website designs.

## Features

- Display contextual information about the user's local energy grid
- Show different states based on grid carbon intensity (low, moderate, high, or unknown)
- Allow users to opt-out of automatically applying grid-aware website designs
- Enable users to manually switch between different design modes

## Installation

### Via npm

```bash
npm install @greenweb/gaw-info-bar
```

### Import from a CDN

Add the component to your project's HTML using a `script` tag using a code CDN.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/@greenweb/gaw-info-bar"></script>
```

### Add manually to a project

Add the component to a project manually. To do this:

1. Copy the `dist/gaw-info-bar.js` file to your project.
2. In your project's HTML add the following script tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="path/to/gaw-info-bar.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Add the component to your HTML and configure it with appropriate data attributes:

```html
<gaw-info-bar data-gaw-level="low" data-gaw-location="US"> </gaw-info-bar>
```

### Attributes

| Attribute                    | Description                                      | Values                                                 | Default                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `data-gaw-level`             | Current carbon intensity level                   | `"low"`, `"moderate"`, `"high"`                        | `undefined` (shows as "Data unavailable") |
| `data-gaw-location`          | Location code                                    | Alpha-2 country code or valid Electricity Maps Zone ID | `undefined` (shows as "Location unknown") |
| `data-ignore-cookie`         | Name of the cookie used to store user preference | Any valid cookie name                                  | `"gaw-ignore"`                            |
| `data-ignore-cookie-max-age` | Max age for the ignore cookie                    | Valid cookie max-age or "Session"                      | `"Session"`                               |

## Grid Intensity Levels

The component displays different states based on the specified grid intensity level:

### Low Intensity

```html
<gaw-info-bar data-gaw-level="low" data-gaw-location="TW"></gaw-info-bar>
```

Shows a green indicator with message "Your local grid: Cleaner than average."

### Moderate Intensity

```html
<gaw-info-bar data-gaw-level="moderate" data-gaw-location="TW"></gaw-info-bar>
```

Shows an orange indicator with message "Your local grid: Around average emissions."

### High Intensity

```html
<gaw-info-bar data-gaw-level="high" data-gaw-location="TW"></gaw-info-bar>
```

Shows a red indicator with message "Your local grid: Dirtier than average."

### Unknown Intensity

```html
<gaw-info-bar data-gaw-location="TW"></gaw-info-bar>
```

Shows a gray indicator with message "Your local grid: Data unavailable."

## Location Support

The component supports displaying user-friendly location names for:

- Regular country codes (e.g., "TW" for Taiwan)
- Regions (e.g., "AU-NSW" for New South Wales, Australia)
- Complex regions (e.g., "US-CENT-SPA" displays as "USA - Central")

These location identifiers align with the zones supported by the [Electricity Maps API](https://portal.electricitymaps.com/docs/getting-started#geographical-coverage).

## User Controls

The component provides users with two types of controls:

1. **Auto/Manual Toggle**: Allows users to switch between automatic grid-aware design (based on actual grid intensity) and manual selection.

2. **Manual Mode Buttons**: When auto mode is disabled, users can select between low, moderate, and high grid intensity design modes.

These settings are stored in cookies to persist user preferences across page loads:

- `gaw-ignore`: Stores whether the user has opted out of automatic grid-aware design
- `gaw-manual-view`: Stores the user's manually selected grid intensity level

## Browser Support

This component is built using standard web components and supports all modern browsers.
